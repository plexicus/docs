# Workflow

1. **Initiating Repository Analysis**:  
   An **Admin**, **Cyberoper**, or **Developer** begins by analyzing a new repository.

2. **Findings Creation**:  
   Once the repository is analyzed, AI generates findings and suggests improvements.

3. **File Editing and Review**:  
   - The **Admin** or **Cyberoper** reviews and edits the file containing AI-driven improvements.  
   - They send the edited file to the **Developer**.

4. **Developer Review and Finalization**:  
   - The **Developer** analyzes the suggested improvements.  
   - They can make additional edits or finalize the changes by creating a pull request to update the file.
