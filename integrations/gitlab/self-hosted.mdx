# Generate Client ID and Secret in GitLab Self-Hosted

Follow these steps to create an **OAuth application** in GitLab Self-Hosted and obtain the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 1. Register an OAuth Application

1. Log in to your **GitLab Self-Hosted instance**.
2. Navigate to **Admin Area** â†’ **Applications** (`/admin/applications`),

5. Fill in the required details:

   	alt="Form Application"
   />

- **Trusted**: Check this box for allowed **Plexicus** to use application credentials as a trusted first-party application.
- **Name**: Enter a meaningful name for the application.
- **Redirect URI**: Enter the callback URL where GitLab should redirect after authentication.
- **Scopes**: Choose the required access levels, e.g., `api`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`.

6. Click **"Save application"**.

## 2. Get Client ID and Client Secret

	alt="Application Created"
/>

After saving the application, GitLab will generate:

- **Application ID (Client ID)**: Used as the `client_id`.
- **Secret (Client Secret)**: Used as the `client_secret`.

These credentials will be used in the next step to obtain an **access token**.

<Warning>
	Keep your **Client Secret** private and never expose it in public repositories
	or frontend applications.
</Warning>

Next, you can proceed to exchanging an authorization code for an access token. ðŸš€
