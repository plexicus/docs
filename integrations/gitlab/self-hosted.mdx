## 1. Register an OAuth Application

   	alt="Form Application"
   />

- **Scopes**: The following scopes are required for different areas:

  - `read_api`: For basic API access to GitLab endpoints
  - `read_user`: For accessing user information
  - `read_repository`: For accessing repository data and branches, reading and accessing issues
  - `write_repository`: For creating merge requests and managing webhooks, creating and managing issues
  - `api`: For general API access to all repository endpoints, managing CI/CD variables and secrets. Creating, updating, and deleting webhooks
  - `openid`: Required for OpenID Connect authentication
  - `profile`: Access to basic profile information
  - `email`: Access to user email information

- **Trusted**: Check this box for allowed **Plexicus** to use application credentials as a trusted first-party application.
- **Name**: Enter a meaningful name for the application.
- **Redirect URI**: Enter this callback URL: `https://covulor.plexicus.com/api/callback/gitlab`

6. Click **"Save application"**.

## 2. Get Client ID and Client Secret

<Warning>
	Ensure you select the required scopes (`openid`, `profile`, `email`,
	`read_api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`, `api`). We
	follow the principle of least privilege and only request permissions that are
	essential for Plexicus's functionality. These scopes provide the necessary
	access for authentication and repository operations while maintaining
	security.
</Warning>

	alt="Application Created"
/>

After saving the application, GitLab will generate:

- **Application ID (Client ID)**: Used as the `client_id`.
- **Secret (Client Secret)**: Used as the `client_secret`.

These credentials will be used in the next step to obtain an **access token**.

<Warning>
	Keep your **Client Secret** private and never expose it in public repositories
	or frontend applications.
</Warning>

Next, you can proceed to exchanging an authorization code for an access token. ðŸš€
