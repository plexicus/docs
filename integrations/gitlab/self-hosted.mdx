# Generate Client ID and Secret in GitLab Self-Hosted

Follow these steps to create an **OAuth application** in GitLab Self-Hosted and obtain the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 1. Register an OAuth Application

1. Log in to your **GitLab Self-Hosted instance**.
2. Navigate to **Admin Area** → **Applications** (`/admin/applications`),

3. or go to **User Settings** → **Applications** (`/-/profile/applications`) for user-specific tokens.

   />

5. Fill in the required details:

   	alt="Form Application"
   />

- **Trusted**: Check this box for allowed **Plexicus** to use application credentials as a trusted first-party application.
- **Name**: Enter a meaningful name for the application.
- **Redirect URI**: Enter this callback URL: `https://covulor.plexicus.com/api/callback/gitlab`
- **Scopes**: The following scopes are required for different areas:

  - `openid`: Required for OpenID Connect authentication
  - `profile`: Access to basic profile information
  - `email`: Access to user email information
  - `read_api`: For basic API access to GitLab endpoints
  - `read_user`: For accessing user information
  - `read_repository`: For accessing repository data and branches, reading and accessing issues
  - `write_repository`: For creating merge requests and managing webhooks, creating and managing issues
  - `api`: For general API access to all repository endpoints, managing CI/CD variables and secrets. Creating, updating, and deleting webhooks

6. Click **"Save application"**.

## 2. Get Client ID and Client Secret

<Warning>
	Ensure you select the required scopes (`openid`, `profile`, `email`,
	`read_api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`, `api`). While
	the screenshot may display additional scopes, we follow the principle of least
	privilege and only request permissions that are essential for Plexicus's
	functionality. These scopes provide the minimum necessary access for
	authentication and repository operations while maintaining security.
</Warning>

	alt="Application Created"
/>

After saving the application, GitLab will generate:

- **Application ID (Client ID)**: Used as the `client_id`.
- **Secret (Client Secret)**: Used as the `client_secret`.

These credentials will be used in the next step to obtain an **access token**.

<Warning>
	Keep your **Client Secret** private and never expose it in public repositories
	or frontend applications.
</Warning>

Next, you can proceed to exchanging an authorization code for an access token. 🚀
