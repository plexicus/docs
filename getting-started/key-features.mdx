Below is an overview of the core capabilities of **Plexicus CNAPP** that help you build, deploy, and operate applications with confidence.

#### 1. **Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)**

Secure your applications from the earliest stages of development. Plexicus's ASPM capabilities integrate directly into your CI/CD pipeline to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your code and open-source dependencies.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** <br />
    Detect vulnerabilities in your source code with tools like Checkmarx, Semgrep, and Fortify, ensuring compliance with standards like the OWASP Top 10.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** <br />
    Identify vulnerabilities and manage license compliance in your third-party libraries using tools such as OWASP Dependency Check and integrating with SBOM tools like Trivy and Syft.
- **Secrets Scanning** <br />
    Prevent exposure of sensitive credentials like API keys and passwords with leading tools such as TruffleHog and Gitleaks.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security** <br />
    Scan Terraform, Kubernetes, and other IaC scripts for misconfigurations using TFLint, KICS, and Hadolint.

#### 2. **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**

Gain full visibility into your cloud environments and ensure they remain secure and compliant. Plexicus integrates with CSPM tools like CloudSploit to continuously monitor your AWS, Azure, and GCP infrastructure, identify misconfigurations, and mitigate cloud-specific risks before they can be exploited.

#### 3. **Container Security**

Protect your containerized applications and Kubernetes environments. Plexicus offers robust scanning and configuration analysis to secure every layer of your container stack.

- **Vulnerability Scanning** <br />
    Identify known vulnerabilities in your container images using powerful scanners like Trivy, Grype, and Checkov.
- **Secure Configuration** <br />
    Ensure your Docker and Kubernetes environments are configured securely to prevent common attack vectors.

#### 4. **Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)**

Safeguard your cloud workloads against modern threats. Plexicus's CWPP capabilities provide real-time threat detection and protection for your virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions running in the cloud.

- **Threat and Malware Detection** <br />
    Proactively scan for malicious code and supply chain threats using advanced tools like Yara, ClamAV, and SLSA.
- **Workload Monitoring** <br />
    Gain deep visibility into running workloads to detect and respond to suspicious activity in real-time.

#### 5. **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)**

Manage and enforce least-privilege access across your cloud infrastructure. Plexicus's CIEM capabilities help you understand who has access to what, identify excessive permissions, and right-size entitlements to reduce the risk of credential misuse and insider threats.
